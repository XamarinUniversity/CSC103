			Here you will write a program to help restaurant diners calculate the tip and split
			the bill evenly among the group members. The main goal is to write a class with a field
			and some methods. A secondary goal is to practice with input/output, variables,
			and control flow. Sample output from the completed application is shown below.

		<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the high-level instructions to implement the program.
		</p>

		<h2>Tip Calculation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create a new <strong>Console Project</strong> in <strong>Visual Studio</strong>.
				Name the Project and Solution <strong>TipCalculation</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Create a new class named <code>Tipper</code>. Be sure to put it in its own file in your project.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add a <code>public</code> field of type <code>double</code> inside the <code>Tipper</code> class
				to store the total amount of the restaurant bill.
			</li>

			<li>
				Implement two <code>public</code> methods inside the <code>Tipper</code> class to calculate the tip:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>CalculateTip</code>: takes one <code>double</code> parameter which represents the desired
						tip percentage, computes the tip, and returns the tip amount.
					</li>

					<li>
						<code>CalculateTip</code>: takes no parameters, computes a 15% tip, and returns the tip amount.
						Note that this is <em>method overloading</em> since the two <code>CalculateTip</code> methods
						have the same name. This is legal in C# since the parameter lists are different (i.e. one of the
						methods takes 1 parameter and the other takes 0 parameters).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				Implement one <code>public</code> method inside the <code>Tipper</code> class to split the bill based
				on the number of diners. Name the method <code>Divvy</code>. It must take
				an <code>int</code> parameter which specifies the number of diners, calculate the amount each should
				pay if the bill is split evenly, and return that amount.
			</li>

			<li>
				Open <strong>Program.cs</strong>. You will be adding code to <code>Main</code> to allow the user
				to calculate tips and divvy restaurant bills.
			</li>

			<li>
				Create an instance of the <code>Tipper</code> class.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add a loop so the remaining steps can be done repeatedly until the user quits the program.
				There are two common ways to write a "forever" loop (see below), please use whichever you
				prefer. Use a <code>break</code> inside the loop to exit the loop when the user asks
				to quit the program.
<pre class="prettyprint">
for (;;)
{
}

while (true)
{
}
</pre>
				The remaining steps will go inside the loop.
			</li>

			<li>
				Read the amount of a restaurant bill from the user and load it into the field of the <code>Tipper</code> object.
			</li>

			<li>
				Ask the user which operation they would like to perform (bad tip, OK tip, good tip, or divvy bill).
				Read the user response and obtain a single character to represent the operation. This code is fairly
				tricky so it is given below; you can use this code exactly as-is in your program.
<pre class="prettyprint">
Console.Write("B)ad tip O)k tip G)ood Tip D)ivvy the bill Q)uit: ");
char operation = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper()[0];
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Perform the calculation the user requested based on the operation they entered. Here are a few
				notes to help you:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the user enters 'B', 'O', or 'G', calculate and output a tip of 10%, 15%, or 20% respectively.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the user enters 'D', you will need to read the number of diners from the user and then
						calculate and output the per-diner amount.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the user enters 'Q', you should exit the loop (which will then exit the program).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				Build and run the program to test your work.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		This program let you practice with classes and methods. In particular, you saw a class used
		in its role as "container for related fields and methods". Grouping these together helps you
		organize your code in a logical way which should make it easier to work on the code in the
		future. For example, if you need to modify or extend the tip-calculation code you will know
		right where to find since all the tip-related code is inside the <code>Tipper</code> class.
